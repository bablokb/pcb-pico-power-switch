Pico Power Switch
=================

![](pcb.jpg)

This is a simple breakout to switch the battery power for a Raspberry
Pi Pico to minimize battery usage.

Functions:

  * Enable using a button, a RTC or an external signal
  * Disable by pulling a GPIO high from your program
  * keep time

The target application of this design is a program that runs in
intervals. After startup the program executes it's tasks, sets the
next wakup time and then pulls the "done"-GPIO high.  The circuitry
then cuts power, thus limiting the battery consumption to a very low
level. Measured current draw in off-mode is 0.38ÂµA.

The design of the breakout allows it to be connected directly on the bottom
side of the Pico.

Hardware Components
-------------------

A D-type flip-flop drives the gate of a p-channel mosfet and
switches power (source: battery, drain: VSYS). 
A button, the RTC or an external signal will reset the flip-flop.
This will pull the gate low, thus enabling power.

The "done"-pin of the Pico is connected to the CLK-pin of
the flip-flop. A rising edge will toggle the output and pull
the gate high, which in turn cuts power.

A second p-channel mosfet will prevent back-powering from VBUS
in case the Pico is connected using the USB-connector. The
voltage-drop across this mosfet is about 0.1V.

Software
--------

A simple example program implemented in CircuitPython
is provided in `src/main.py`. The software provides some boilerplate
code for timer and alarm-based wake up.

In timer-mode, the program uses the countdown-timer of the rtc. It
blinks the on-board LED for ten seconds, then goes to sleep for 15 seconds.

Measured current:

For longer intervals alarm-based wake up is more suitable. Since the rtc
does not support seconds for alarms, it will always fire on "full minutes".
The current measurement demonstrates this behavior (the first off-interval
is shorter than the following off-intervals)
